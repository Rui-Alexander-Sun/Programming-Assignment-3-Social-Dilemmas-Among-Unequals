# Programming-Assignment-3-Unequal-Public-Goods-Game
In the final assignment of our programming course, we were allowed to freely choose an experiment program to replicate. I replicated the public goods game among unequals designed by Hauser et al. (2019).

The codes will be uploaded after being checked by Turnitin.
